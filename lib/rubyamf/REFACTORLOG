* Optimize deserialization ActiveRecord and ActiveResource in populators to utilize RubyAMF mapping without
  vo_helper.

* Get rid of register_by_class_names in favor of application initialization automatically registering classes that
  call the register_amf method in them?

* Combine legacy files and set up so that legacy RubyAMF loads as a plugin and Rails 3 as a gem and use version
  checking to throw errors if not implemented that way.

* Update request logging with legacy response time strings.

* Implement use_ruby_datetime mapping.

* Implement legacy parameter mapping to params hash.

* Error handling combined?
